# Coms599_ML_demo

## [Introduction]
This is a repo for a demonstration of the 402C presentation.
The presentation will introduce the machine learning concept from a neural network to the Seq2seq model with attention.

Here, we link our Jupiter Notebook files to a Google Colab session, which allows us to demo these models using Google's GPUs without having to install anything locally.
